LibRPA
======

**LibRPA** is a library for efficient and accurate first-principles calculations
based on many-body perturbation theory with numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs).
It currently supports random-phase approximation (RPA) correlation-energy
calculations and GW quasiparticle calculations for periodic systems. By
leveraging the localized resolution of identity (LRI) technique, LibRPA
achieves low-scaling algorithms suitable for large-scale systems. Implemented
in C++ with MPI/OpenMP parallelism and equipped with C and Fortran
interfaces, LibRPA can be integrated with density functional theory (DFT) codes
through both file-based and API-based workflows.

**Key Features**

- RPA correlation energy calculations and GW quasiparticle calculations for atomic basis framework.
- Low-scaling algorithms based on the localized resolution of identity (LRI) technique.
- Efficient treatment of large-scale periodic systems.
- Hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism for scalability and performance.
- Flexible integration with external DFT packages through driver-based and API-based interfaces.
