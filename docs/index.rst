LibRPA
======

**LibRPA** is a comprehensive library designed for efficient and accurate first-principles calculations of random-phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies using numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs). It leverages the Localized Resolution of Identity (LRI) technique to achieve :math:`O(N^2)` scaling behavior, making it highly suitable for large-scale periodic systems. Implemented in C++ and Python with MPI/OpenMP parallelism, LibRPA integrates seamlessly with various density functional theory (DFT) packages through flexible file-based and API-based interfaces.

**Key Features:**

- Accurate computation of physical properties using many-body perturbation theory.
- Efficient handling of large-scale periodic systems with :math:`O(N^2)` scaling.
- Hybrid parallelism (MPI/OpenMP) to enhance scalability and performance.
- Seamless integration with various DFT packages through flexible interfaces.
