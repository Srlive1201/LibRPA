# Dataset Format

## `stru_out`

This file contains structure and k-mesh data.
It should contain the following data in order
- lattice vectors: 3 lines, 3 float number in each line, unit: Bohr radius
- reciprocal lattice vectors: 3 lines, 3 float number in each line, unit: inverse Bohr radius
- number of k-grids along each lattice vectors: 1 line, `nkx`, `nky`, `nkz`. The
  total number of k-points `nkpts` equals to the product of `nkx`, `nky` and
  `nkz`
- Cartesian coordinates of each k-point: `nkpts` lines, 3 float number in each line, unit: inverse Bohr radius
- mapping of k-point to its irreducible counterpart: `nkpts` lines, 1 integer in each line.

The mapping should be considered as below:
suppose the number on the `n`-th line is `m`, it means that
the irreducible k-point corresponding to the `n`-th k-point in the full k-point set is the `m`-th
k-point in the full set.

## `Cs_data_xxx.txt`

These files contain the localized RI triple coefficients.
In plain text format, each file has a header with two integers:
total number of atoms and number of periodic unit cells.
Then till the end of file, the data is formatted as blocks of RI coefficient $C$ on each pair of atoms and unit cell
```
i_atom_1  i_atom_2  n_1  n_2  n_3  n_basis_1  n_basis_2  n_aux_basis_1
C(1, 1, 1)
...
C(n_aux_basis_1, n_basis_2, n_basis_1)
```
Here `C` is the RI coefficients between the atom `i_atom_1` and `i_atom_2` in unit cells separated by
$\mathbf{R} = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \mathbf{a}_3$.
The auxiliary basis is located on `i_atom_1`. The number of basis functions on `i_atom_1` and `i_atom_2` 
are `n_basis_1` and `n_basis_2`, respectively. The number of auxiliary functions is `n_aux_basis_1`.
The indices of `C` runs in the Fortran order, i. e. the first index runs the fastest.

## `band_out`

This file contains band energies and occupation numbers from the mean-field starting-point calculation.
It has a 5-line header
```
n_k_points
n_spins
n_states
n_basis
e_fermi
```
The first 4 lines contain an integer in each. The 5th line is a float number, which is the Fermi energy
in Hartree unit.

The remaining lines consists of `n_k_points*n_spins` blocks of `n_states+1` lines, in the format of
```
i_k_point    i_spin
1           f_1        e_1_ha      e_1_ev
2           f_2        e_2_ha      e_2_ev
3           f_3        e_3_ha      e_3_ev
...
n           f_n        e_n_ha      e_n_ev
...
```
This block contains the energies and occupation numbers of states $\left|\psi_{n,k\sigma}\right\rangle$
`i_k_point` marks the index of k-point $k$ in the full k-point set.
`i_spin` specify the spin channel $\sigma$.
In each of the following lines, the first integer species the index of state.
The 3 float numbers stand for the occupation number, the energy in Hartree unit and that in electronvolt
unit, respectively.
For spin-unpolarized calculation, `f_n` is a number from 0 to 2, otherwise it is from 0 to 1.

## `KS_eigenvector_xxx.txt`
These files contain the wave functions (eigenvectors) from the starting-point calculation expanded by orbital basis.
Each file can be divided in blocks of `n_states*n_basis*n_spins+1` lines,
where `n_states`, `n_basis` and `n_spins` will be extracted from `band_out` file.
Each block stores the data for a particular k-point, $c^i_{n,k\sigma}$:
```
i_k_point
c(1,1,1)_real c(1,1,1)_imag
...
c(i,n,s)_real c(i,n,s)_imag
...
```
The first line contains single integer, the index of the k-point of following data.
The remaining lines store the data with running index $i$, $n$, $\sigma$ in C order,
i. e., spin index runs fastest, then state index and basis index finally.
Each line has two float numbers, which are the real and imaginary part of $c^i_{n,k\sigma}$.

## `coulomb_mat_xxx.txt`

These files contains the Coulomb matrices in auxiliary basis.
A single header line contains an integer, the number of irreducible k-point at
which the Coulomb matrices are computed.
The remaining part of the file is organized in blocks
```
n_aux_basis    row_start    row_end    col_start    col_end
i_k_point      k_weight
v(row_start, col_start  )_real       v(row_start, col_start  )_imag
v(row_start, col_start+1)_real       v(row_start, col_start+1)_imag
...
v(row_end, col_end)_real             v(row_end, col_end)_imag
```
where
- integer `n_aux_basis` is the total number of auxiliary basis functions.
- integer `row_start`, `row_end`, `col_start` and `col_end` mark the submatrix of the full Coulomb matrix
  that this block contain.
- integer `i_k_point` is the index of k-point of the current Coulomb matrix, in the full k-point list.
- float number `k_weight` is the weight of the irreducible k-points.

After the block header, there should be `(row_end-row_start+1)` times `(col_end-col_start+1)` lines
for the actual matrix element data. Each line contains two float numbers, which are the real and imaginary
parts of the element. The data is ordered in C-style column major.
