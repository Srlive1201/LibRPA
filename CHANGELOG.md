# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-23

### Breaking changes

- Changed `output_gw_sigc_mat_kf` NAO self-energy exports from Matrix Market
  `.mtx` to dense binary `.bin`. Update readers of `SigcKF_*` output to the
  format documented in `librpa_options.h`.
- Changed the default number of time/frequency points, `nfreq`, from 6 to 16.

### Added

- Added experimental fixed-basis `qsgw` and `qsgw_band` tasks with native
  FHI-aims/ABACUS Vxc input, Hamiltonian mixing and truncation, and iteration
  diagnostics. Same-grid analytic head correction is supported; Hartree,
  independent-grid head, and wing updates remain unsupported.
- Added `input_preset` for `fhi-aims` (alias `aims`), `abacus`, and
  `abacus-legacy`, plus configurable `prefix_velocity`. The legacy preset
  retains unsuffixed ABACUS filenames and the ABACUS velocity reader.
- Added `output_exx_mat_k` for dense binary NAO-basis EXX matrices on the
  k-grid and band path, including spinor blocks.
- Added binary regression-data extraction with selectable field groups.
- Added detailed profiling of Green-function construction, response
  collection, matrix operations, and MPI waits.

### Changed

- Changed CPU LibRI EXX, response, and GW work distribution to use weights
  based on the number of basis functions on each atom, and updated bundled LibRI.
- Changed driver file-reader organization through a major refactor, moving
  shared readers into `driver/reader` and the experimental
  `librpa_file_reader` library, independent of driver state and available with
  `LIBRPA_ENABLE_DRIVER=OFF`. The `file_reader.hpp` API lets external programs,
  such as LibBSE, reuse LibRPA dataset formats and file parsing, with configurable
  input filenames and prefixes.

### Fixed

- Fixed Gamma head/wing corrections for filtered Coulomb subspaces,
  including the case with only the head channel retained, and avoided forming
  the full body projector during matrix construction.
- Fixed missing ELSI CSC size and index validation and unaligned value reads.
- Fixed missing KS, EXX, and GW band-edge and gap analysis on the k-grid and band
  path, retaining the mean-field occupied/empty band partition and adding
  warnings for higher empty GW states below the mean-field Fermi level.
- Fixed suppressed RPA, EXX, and G0W0 result tables, timing summaries, and
  MPI/build information at `warning` and `critical` output levels.
- Fixed output-level filtering for structural and time/frequency-grid
  diagnostics and collective messages.
- Fixed missing propagation of library feature definitions to CMake
  consumers, keeping exposed C++ data types consistent with the library build.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-02

### Breaking changes

- API `librpa_set_kgrids_kvec` changed to accept the number of loaded SCF
  k-points explicitly and optional k-point weights. C++/Fortran bindings
  changed accordingly: `set_kgrids_kvec`.
- API `librpa_set_ibz_mapping` was renamed to `librpa_set_kq_mapping`.
  C++/Fortran bindings changed accordingly: `set_ibz_mapping` was renamed to
  `set_kq_mapping`.

### Added

- New public APIs:
  - Global output control: `librpa_set_output_level` and
    `librpa_get_output_level`.
  - Restart setup: `librpa_set_restart_from_dir`.
  - Auxiliary-basis and symmetry metadata: `librpa_set_ao_basis_aux_shrink`,
    `librpa_set_basis_convention`, and `librpa_set_symmetry_operations`.
  - Packed-complex Coulomb input:
    `librpa_set_aux_bare_coulomb_k_atom_pair_packed`,
    `librpa_set_aux_cut_coulomb_k_atom_pair_packed`,
    `librpa_set_aux_bare_coulomb_k_2d_block_packed`, and
    `librpa_set_aux_cut_coulomb_k_2d_block_packed`.
  - Velocity-matrix input: `librpa_set_velocity_matrix` and
    `librpa_set_velocity_matrix_packed`.
  - GW quasiparticle and spectral-function retrieval:
    `librpa_get_g0w0_qpe_kgrid`, `librpa_get_g0w0_qpe_band_k`,
    `librpa_get_g0w0_spectral_function_kgrid`, and
    `librpa_get_g0w0_spectral_function_band_k`.
- Added CUDA and HIP acceleration for EXX, RPA, GW, and head/wing calculations
  through LibDDLA, GPU-enabled LibRI, and optional ELPA routines.
- Added support for bundled or external ELPA and bundled or external LibDDLA
  installations.
- Added two-level k-point/BLACS parallelism for eigenvector redistribution,
  density and Green functions, EXX, response, and GW calculations.
- Added versioned binary readers for Coulomb matrices, LRI coefficients, KS
  eigenvectors, and velocity matrices, with automatic format detection and
  legacy-data conversion utilities.
- Added selectable iterative, quasi-Newton, and perturbative quasiparticle
  solvers, adaptive damping, fallback output, Hedin's shift, and independent
  analytic-continuation grids and resampling.
- Added symmetry-operation input APIs, basis-shell metadata, k-star
  reconstruction, and configurable Born-von Kármán remapping.
- Added analytic GW and RPA head/wing workflows, response-collection chunking,
  and sparse-block handling.
- Added restart loading from a separate directory and outputs for atom-pair
  screened interactions, k-frequency self-energies, ranged EXX/self-energy
  matrices, and binary spectral functions.

### Changed

- Changed driver input handling to auto-detect supported dataset formats and
  exposed input filenames and prefixes as runtime parameters.
- Changed the default Born-von Kármán remapping to consider multiple periodic
  images.
- Changed the iterative quasiparticle solver to residual mixing and tightened
  its default convergence threshold.
- Improved memory use and scaling in response Fourier transforms, screened
  interactions, self-energy rotation, and symmetry-enabled calculations.
- Made the driver fail cleanly on missing input files, unknown tasks, and
  initialization or task exceptions while finalizing LibRPA and MPI as applicable.
- Made the required MPI thread-support level configurable at build time and
  added startup reporting of the requested and provided levels.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `task = g0w0_band`; use `task = g0w0`. The old value remains an
  accepted alias.
- Deprecated the monolithic `basis_out`, `symrot_k`, and
  `irreducible_sector.txt` inputs in favor of split basis data and parsed
  symmetry operations.
- Retained several renamed runtime parameters as compatibility aliases; the
  preferred names are listed in the runtime-parameter documentation.

### Fixed

- Fixed symmetry reconstruction and k-parallel execution for EXX, RPA, GW,
  spinor wavefunctions, and head/wing corrections, including an MPI hang.
- Fixed head/wing normalization, shrink-basis selection, GPU execution, and
  dielectric-solver error reporting.
- Fixed small-basis calculations with large MPI task counts, non-LibRI
  response routes, distributed wavefunction layouts, and multiple input/output
  regressions.
